Automatic Fuel Dispenser System is design using  ESP32  microcontrooler that that automates fuel delivery at a small-scale fuel station .

It uses a 4x4 keypad for user input, a 20x4 I2C LCD for displaying prompts and real-time data, an MFRC522 RFID module for card payments, and a YF-S201 flow sensor to accurately measure dispensed fuel (calibrated at 450 pulses per liter, 5 Cedis per liter).

Users enter a monetary amount, select a payment method (RFID card or mobile money(MoMo)), and confirm details before the system dispenses the calculated fuel volume via a relay-controlled pump

Components used in this Project:
* ESP32 Microcontroller
* RFID reader and card  used for card transaction
* 4 by 4 Matrix keypad
* 20 by 4 I2C LCD
* YF-S201 Water Flow Sensor
* 240L/H 12V micro water pump
